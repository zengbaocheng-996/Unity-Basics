| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Building a Graph      | Create a prefab<br />Instantiate multiple cubes<br />Show a mathematical function<br />Create a surface shader and shader graph<br />Animate the graph | 01      |
| Mathematical Surfaces | Create a function library<br />Use a delegate and an enumeration type<br />Display 2D functions with a grid<br />Define surfaces in 3D space | 01      |
| Measuring Performance | Use game window stats, frame debugger, and profiler<br />Compare dynamic batching, GPU instancing, and SRP batcher<br />Display a frame rate counter<br />Cycle through functions automatically<br />Smoothly transition between functions | 01      |
| Compute Shaders       | Store positions in a compute buffer<br />Let the GPU do most of the work<br />Procedurally draw many cubes<br />Copy the entire function library to the GPU | 01      |
| Jobs                  | Build a fractal with an object hierarchy<br />Flatten the hierarchy<br />Get rid of game objects and draw procedurally<br />Use jobs to update the fractal<br />Update parts of the fractal in parallel | 02      |
| Organic Variety       | Color the fractal based on depth<br />Apply random sequence-based variety<br />Introduce leaves that look different<br />Make the fractal sag as if by gravity<br />Add variety to spin and sometimes reverse it | 02      |
